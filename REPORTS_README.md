# Design Reports

This directory contains automated report generation scripts for the OpenLane design flow metrics. These scripts parse the OpenLane output metrics and generate comprehensive reports in different categories.

## Available Reports

### 1. Area Report (`area_report.py`)

Generates a detailed area analysis of the design including die area, core area, utilization, and cell statistics.

**Features:**
- Die and Core Area metrics
- Cell utilization percentages
- Total cell count and breakdown (logic, decap, welltap, filler cells)
- Gate-level statistics (AND, NAND, OR, NOR, XOR, MUX, DFF)
- Routing metrics (wire length, via count, HPWL)
- Standard cell library information

**Usage:**
```bash
python3 area_report.py
```

**Output Example:**
```
AREA METRICS:
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Die Area:             0.004998 mm²
Core Area:            2,953 µm² (0.002953 mm²)
Die Area (µm²):       4,998 µm²

UTILIZATION:
----------------------------------------------------------------------
OpenDP Utilization:   54.05%
Final Utilization:    -1%
Core Utilization:     50%
```

### 2. Timing Report (`timing_report.py`)

Provides comprehensive timing analysis including critical path, setup/hold times, and clock constraints.

**Features:**
- Critical path timing
- Clock period and frequency
- Worst Negative Slack (WNS) and Total Negative Slack (TNS)
- Pre and post-optimization timing metrics
- Clock constraints and frequency specifications
- Timing violations summary

**Usage:**
```bash
python3 timing_report.py
```

**Output Example:**
```
TIMING METRICS:
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Clock Period:         20.0 ns
Max Frequency:        50.0 MHz
Critical Path:        1.26 ns
```

### 3. Power Report (`power_report.py`)

Detailed power analysis across different corner conditions (slowest, typical, fastest).

**Features:**
- Internal power dissipation
- Switching power (dynamic)
- Leakage power (static)
- Power analysis at multiple corners:
  - Slowest corner
  - Typical corner
  - Fastest corner
- Total power summary
- Power breakdown visualization

**Usage:**
```bash
python3 power_report.py
```

**Output Example:**
```
POWER ANALYSIS (Typical):
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Internal Power:       9.61e-05 µW
Switching Power:      3.53e-05 µW
Leakage Power:        1.11e-09 µW
Total Power:          1.314e-04 µW
```

## Data Source

All reports are generated from the OpenLane metrics file:
```
reports/stepper_ctrl/metrics.csv
```

This CSV file is automatically generated by OpenLane during the design flow and contains comprehensive metrics across all stages of the flow.

**Flow Status:** flow completed

**Standard Cell Library:** sky130_fd_sc_hd

**Total Runtime:** 0h1m22s0ms

## Running All Reports

To generate all three reports in sequence:

```bash
python3 area_report.py
python3 timing_report.py
python3 power_report.py
```

Or create a batch script:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
echo "Generating Design Reports..."
echo ""
echo "========== AREA REPORT =========="
python3 area_report.py
echo ""
echo "========== TIMING REPORT =========="
python3 timing_report.py
echo ""
echo "========== POWER REPORT =========="
python3 power_report.py
```

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Access to OpenLane metrics CSV file at: `reports/stepper_ctrl/metrics.csv`

## Notes

- Reports are read-only and do not modify any source files
- All metrics are sourced from the OpenLane flow output
- Timing and power numbers are specific to the current design configuration
- For updated metrics, re-run the OpenLane flow and regenerate reports
